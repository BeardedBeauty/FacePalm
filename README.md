# SyntactictSugar

FacePalm, our final project, is built on a full MERN stack. This project effectively utilizes our abilities to create a working web app back to front form the ground up.

the original project can be viewed at
• Github: https://github.com/LilGherkin/SyntactictSugar
• Heroku: https://syntactictsugar.herokuapp.com/

This version of the app is simply a cleaned up and updated version of the original. Elements are reorganized somewhat, and things slightly out of place are now appropriately positioned.
